### network.teachingmachine.tv network theme

_The Teaching Machine Network Theme is a Child of Wordpress TwentyFourteen native theme. It hides certain features (like tags) in order to maintain a streamlined appearance, and relies on WP Categories as the principal method of organization. It can accommodate a number of featured projects, which act as sticky posts and are displayed at the top of the main index._

### Usage

Included in this repository are the core php/css files Wordpress uses. In addition, the Teaching Machine Network subdomain also utilizes a number of WP Plug-ins for additional functionality [not included in this repository].

Featured projects (sticky posts) need the 'featured' tag added to them in the Post editor. Featured Images for Posts are added in the usual way (Post editor) and support GIF file format, although not all dimensions of .gif are supported.
